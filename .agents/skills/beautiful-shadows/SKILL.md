# Beautiful Shadows

> Adapted from [MengTo/Skills](https://github.com/MengTo/Skills) (`agent-skills/web-design/beautiful-shadows`). Scoped to ScholarDocX conventions.

## Use When
- A surface needs polished, layered elevation.
- Default Tailwind shadows feel too generic or blunt.
- The design needs neutral, refined depth without colored glow.

## ScholarDocX First
- Before swapping shadows on an existing component, check `AI-Context/technical/frontend-visual-system.md` and the modal rules in `AGENTS.md` — the project has tuned elevation behavior for modals and panels; do not override it casually.
- Prefer the project's existing elevation approach for standard surfaces; use these utilities where you genuinely need refined neutral depth.

## Shadow Utilities
Use these exact Tailwind classes.

### Beautiful sm
Use for compact cards, form controls, pills, and quieter surfaces.

```txt
shadow-[0px_2px_3px_-1px_rgba(0,0,0,0.1),0px_1px_0px_0px_rgba(25,28,33,0.02),0px_0px_0px_1px_rgba(25,28,33,0.08)]
```

### Beautiful md
Use for cards, panels, popovers, and the default elevated surface style.

```txt
shadow-[0px_0px_0px_1px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06),0px_1px_1px_-0.5px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06),0px_3px_3px_-1.5px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06),_0px_6px_6px_-3px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06),0px_12px_12px_-6px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06),0px_24px_24px_-12px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06)]
```

### Beautiful lg
Use for hero media, feature callouts, modal-like containers, and the strongest lift.

```txt
shadow-[0_2.8px_2.2px_rgba(0,_0,_0,_0.034),_0_6.7px_5.3px_rgba(0,_0,_0,_0.048),_0_12.5px_10px_rgba(0,_0,_0,_0.06),_0_22.3px_17.9px_rgba(0,_0,_0,_0.072),_0_41.8px_33.4px_rgba(0,_0,_0,_0.086),_0_100px_80px_rgba(0,_0,_0,_0.12)]
```

## Example

```html
<div class="rounded-xl bg-white shadow-[0px_0px_0px_1px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06),0px_1px_1px_-0.5px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06),0px_3px_3px_-1.5px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06),_0px_6px_6px_-3px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06),0px_12px_12px_-6px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06),0px_24px_24px_-12px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06)]">
  ...
</div>
```

## Usage Rules
- `Beautiful sm` → compact cards, form controls, pills, quieter surfaces.
- `Beautiful md` → cards, panels, popovers, default elevated surface.
- `Beautiful lg` → hero media, feature callouts, modal-like containers, strongest lift.
- Pair with a clean surface fill and a consistent radius.
- One shadow strength per component state unless an interaction clearly changes elevation.

## Avoid
- Mixing these with default Tailwind shadow scales on the same component.
- Tinting these shadows with strong colors; keep them neutral and refined.
- Applying `Beautiful lg` to dense lists or tiny controls.
- Stacking multiple shadow utilities on one element.
- Using these as a substitute for clear borders in very low-contrast layouts.
